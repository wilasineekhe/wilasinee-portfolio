        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="main-intro">
            I'm currently a third-year student majoring in Digital Media Engineering. I have a strong passion for web development, 
            especially in full stack development, 
            where I enjoy both the creative side of designing user interfaces and the technical side of building functional, 
            efficient back-end systems.Over the past few years, I’ve been exploring various web technologies such as
             HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and frameworks like React and Django. 
             I love solving problems, learning new tools, and creating projects that are both useful and user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>I chose to study Digital Media Engineering because I like the idea of creating something that people can use and enjoy, 
            whether it’s a well-designed website, a useful app, or an engaging digital experience. Digital media gives me the opportunity 
            to explore different areas like UI/UX design, animation, programming, and multimedia production, all in one field.</p>

        <h3>Learning Programming: Challenging and Solutions</h3>
        <p>July 11, 2025</p>
        <p>As I continued learning, I realized how big the world of programming really is. There are so many languages and tools 
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, SQL, and more. I felt overwhelmed and didn’t know what to focus on first. 
            It felt like everyone online had different advice, and I didn’t want to make the “wrong” choice.</p>
            
        <p>I started by learning HTML and CSS to build static web pages, then moved on to JavaScript for adding interactivity. 
            Once I got more comfortable, I explored backend tools like Python and Django. Choosing one clear path and sticking to it helped me avoid feeling lost. 
            I realized there’s no perfect starting point—what matters is starting somewhere and building from there.</p>
           
        <p>Through all of these challenges, I’ve come to understand that learning programming is a journey. It’s not about being perfect or knowing everything from the start. 
            It’s about being curious, staying patient, and learning from your mistakes. Every time I debug a tricky error, finish a small project, or finally understand a tough concept,
            I feel more confident and proud of myself.</p>
